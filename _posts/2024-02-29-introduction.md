# About me
Hi there, my name is Denniel, an aspiring Game Dev studying a Bachelor of Games and Interactive Environments at QUT.

# Why Game Dev?
My interest in game dev started with coding a game on Scratch at primary, and forwarded with another game project at high school, this time with GameMaker (the 2011 version). I had come to love the craft of writing functional code, and its struggles. I chose to be a Game Developer to further develop my skills, and to learn new skills seen as "essential" in creating a Game.

# So, what now?
Over the next 8 weeks, i'll be working on a game design project that delves deep into what makes a game tick, and i'll be making a small set of prototype games that tests my understanding of game design.
