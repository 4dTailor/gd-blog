In Week 2, our class has been given 2 weeks to develop a game revolving around
the game genre: `Platformer`. As part of this task, we have to develop an
elevator pitch for our game.

# Mousehand
Mousehand is a platformer game where the player uses
their mouse to move around the world. Change the world
space to solve puzzles, and discover the reason 
behind the power of the Cursor. 

## Controls

- Use WASD to move the alien character, and SPACE to jump

## Selling Points
- Manipulate the world the player's in to get around.
- Multiple different types of objects to interact with
- Interesting story to drive the player forward
