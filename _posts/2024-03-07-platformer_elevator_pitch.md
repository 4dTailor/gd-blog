elevator pitch for our game.

# The Hand of Mice
You've been granted the ability to manipulate the world around you.
With this power, you navigate the strange new world you find yourself in, and
determine the reason behind your powers.

**Points**
- Manipulate the world you're in to get to the world you're in.
