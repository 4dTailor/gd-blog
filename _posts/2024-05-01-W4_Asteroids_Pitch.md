# Week 4
Our second project is to create a new prototype game, themed around
the `Asteroids` genre. 

My elevator pitch for this genre is:

# Elevator Project
Elevator project is an asteroids shoot them up where the player
protects a fragile care package from damage on its way up a 
space elevator. Utilising the care package's upgrading utility,
the player upgrades their ship to handle the ever 
increasing space junk heading towards it.

## Controls
- Use the mouse to point the ship in a direction
- Use left click to fire missiles to destroy asteroids

## Selling Points
- Convert the destroyed asteroids into special upgrades to make defending easier
- Defend the package from a wide variety of space junk.
