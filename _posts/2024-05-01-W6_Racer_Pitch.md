# Week 6
Week 6 begins the third prototype game for this unit.
This time, the game theme is `racer`.

As with the others, this is the elevator pitch:
# Star Chaser
Star Chaser is a space racer where the player uses planets and stars
to gravity assist you in a race to catch the Ocean Star Comet. 
The player uses the planet map to create a path to reach the Ocean Star, and
deal with the situations that might occur during the run.

## Controls
- Use the arrow keys to point the spaceship in a direction
- Use space to activate thrusters

## Selling Points
- Plot out a route to maximise the chances of reaching the Ocean Star
- Make decisions on what to do in the random situations that may happen
- Utilise gravity to speed up the spaceship into ludicrous speeds.
