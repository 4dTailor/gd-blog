# Week 10
And so, Week 10 begins Assignment 3, a group assignment where we have three
weeks to develop and playtest a "prototype". Due to my programming background,
I was assigned the "Programmer" title, and had the unenviable task of programming
the game. 

I started by looking through the prototype plans.

**Prototype plans**
```
4 Scenes:
    - Tutorial scene + Lobby
    - Hotel room 1 – interact with the first NPC suspect.
    - Hotel room 2 – interact with the second NPC suspect.
    - Hotel room 3 – interact with the final NPC suspect and solve the mystery.
A UI that will allow players to see how spooked they are.
    - The bar will remain static while not in contact with ghosts.
    - When the player encounters ghosts then the spook meter will go up in
different intervals [expanded in enemy types]
    - If the player’s spook bar fills to the top, then the game will be forced into the
game over scene.
The player can move and interact with certain platforms and objects to find hidden
clues to the puzzle or item to equip to help fight the ghosts away.
Enemies and enemy types.
    - Angry Ghost
        - This ghost will pace the platforms waiting to scare the player. They will
increase the spook meter by a larger fraction and require more
persistence to scare away.
    - Scared Ghosts
        - These ghosts are sporadic and can travel between platforms.The Curious Case of Hotel Hollow – Minimal Viable Product Report
They do not have a set path and can be scared away with a large
amount of light.
        - When in contact with the player, they will increase the spook meter by
only a small percentage compared to the Angry ghost.
    - Sad Ghosts
        - These ghosts have the same pathing and removal conditions as the
scared ghosts.
        - When in contact with the player will not make a significant increase in
the spook meter.
➢ Ghosts can drop certain clues or equip-able items to help the player progress
through the game.
            - NPCs and Interactable Items:
    - The game will have a minimum of 5 Clues.
        - Murder weapon.
        - NPC specific clues
        - notes
        - Dialogue queues from the victim’s ghost and the suspects in each
level.
    - The NPCs will be the same each run through but will have different themes to
expand the level design and puzzles.
        - The dialogue will be very basic.
    - The tutorial level will include a passive Ghost NPC that is identified as the
murder victim.
        - This ghost will take you through the tutorial level by teaching you the
controls to the game and give you hints on how to solve the different
types of puzzles.
            - In future updates, the ghost will be able to give you additional
clues when you enter each of the NPC’s levels.
    - A save game function where each level will take you through one night.
        - When the clues have been found in each level than the player can
return to the lobby (tutorial scene) to save the game and unlock the
next level.
        - When the player completes the level, the path to the lobby (tutorial
scene) will be illuminated and the player will no longer have to
encounter ghosts.
```

Despite the ~slightly~ ambitious plans, I was hopeful that we could get done a
nice looking prototype.

From the 6th to now, I threw together a barebones project with assets in the 
asset store while I waited for the assets to be drawn together by the team.

I first started on getting the doors and clue collection working, and after a
struggle, I got this working.

> Clue collection, and door animation

I then worked on getting the enemies working.
I had added a slight glow to make them more visible under the dark room.

> This was an interesting bug caused by how i had created the lights.

Eventually, I had those working, and by today, i've got the fundamentals down.
