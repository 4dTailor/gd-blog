# Week 11
This week was, interesting, to say the least.

I had gotten sidetracked by other assignments, and 
I started experimenting with mechanics that interested me.

I considered utilising a flare gun to provide light to provide a safe area.

However, this was decided against as it didn't fit the theme and story of the game.

I also experimented with pushable boxes to act as obstacles.

They worked, and it's currently being considered.

I've also had an interesting situation whereas convening meetings with my team was difficult.
This has added an extra layer of difficulty in communicating.
