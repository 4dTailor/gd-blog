# Week 13
This week saw playtesting happen. 
Our group utilised the Playtesting Party on Tuesday to get 
feedback from a wide variety of people. 

Due to the scheduling of the day, half of the team was unable to attend
which made playtesting a little more difficult. 

Also, the only thing testable at the time was the game mechanics, 
as level designs and art wasn't ready at Playtesting Party.

# Playtesting
Playtesting was quite an educating experience.
It revealed quite a few things I hadn't considered.
A few things I had noticed throughout the session:
- The sight of a large amount of enemies can create the feeling of being overwhelmed, despite them having little impact with the player.
- The visual aspects of the game is more noticeable than the audio.
- Players found games difficult to play if they had no direction.

With this, I took notes of the things playtesters had found, and collected data about the playtesters,
as it was important to note who they were, and how they represent the potential target audience the 
game was aiming for.
